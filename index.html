                        <h3>Queenstown, New Zealand</h3>
                            <img src="images/Queenstown1.jpg" width="150px" height="100px">
                                <p>Queenstown is known as the "Adventure Capital of the World" and for good reason, they invented bungy jumping there.  It is a quaint town at the base of a mountain and next to a freezing cold glacier fed lake.</p>

                        <h3>Dubrovnik, Croatia</h3>
                            <img src="images/Dubrovnik.jpg" width="150px" height="100px">       
                                <p>This wonderful place in Europe is full of history.  The Old Town of Dubrovnik is basically still how it was from the 1400s.  The city was never attacked so the walls are still intact.  Up the coast there are roughly 1000 islands, it is known as the Dalmation Coast.</p>

                        <h3>Whistler, Canada</h3>
                            <img src="images/Whistler.jpg" width="150px" height="100px">
                                <p>Up in the mountains on the pacific coast of Canada, Whistler is an outdoorsman's dream.  They have downhill mountain biking, hiking, white water rafting, bungy jumping, and much more including skiing in the winter.  It is very similar to Queenstown.</p>

                            <h3>Machu Picchu, Peru</h3>
                                <img src="images/Machu Picchu.jpg" width="150px" height="100px">
                                    <p>The Peruvian people are incredibly hospitable, the food is amazing, and the sites are unbelievalbe.  I would return to this magical place in a heartbeat.</p>
